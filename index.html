            Hi, I’m Coding Bee, a back-end developer with over two years of experience. 
            I’ve worked on various projects in Java and C++, including some AI development from scratch. 
            I enjoy tackling challenges and improving my skills, and I appreciate working with others passionate about coding. 
            I’m also excited for the latest tech trends.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>SNN4J</h3>
        <p class="project-description">
            Simple Neuron Networks for Java (SNN4J) is my machine learning library developed from scratch.
            It allows users to create, train, and utilize multi-layer perceptrons (fully connected feedforward networks) with just
            a few lines of code. The primary goal is to serve as a learning resource for those new to AI, so it isn’t highly optimized;
            instead, the code is designed to reflect how this topic is typically explained in textbooks,
            helping users grasp the concepts more easily.

        <h3>Digit Recognizer</h3>
        <p class="project-description">
            Simple project for digit recognition showcasing the ability of my SNN4J library.
            Using a small MLP from the library, only a small part of the MNIST database, and 100 or so iterations,
            it managed to get 75% accuracy on a testing dataset with 20 thousand examples.

        <h3>Note Transformer</h3>
        <p class="project-description">
            A custom Transformer architecture designed to generate simple piano music,
             built from scratch to reduce the number of parameters while maintaining high performance. 
             It features custom embeddings, a specialized layer for handling timing, and a custom unembedding process. 
             Future updates will incorporate multiple datasets to improve generalization and music quality.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <h4>Bekeeping</h4>
        <p class="hobby-description">
            I am bekeeper since 2018, and I had many amazing achivements since than. In the Czech national beekeeping competition
            "Zlatá včela" I managed to win once(2022) and two times get the third place(2023, 2024). I even succeeded in the
            international competition IMYB in 2024, where our Czech team won.
        </p>
        <h4>Acting</h4>
        <p class="hobby-description">
            In the fourth grade I started going to our local art school, and stayed there for six years in total. During that 
            time I also joined local theater club "Divoch", where I stayed to this day.
