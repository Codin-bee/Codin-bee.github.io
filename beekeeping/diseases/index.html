        <p>
            There are tens or maybe even hundreds of different pathogens, viruses, sicknesses and predators 
            threatening the bee colonies around the whole world. Some may be dangerous for the survival of 
            the colonies, while others may make it just a little bit harder, but as beekeepers we should try 
            our best to actively fight all of them. It is our duty to save strong and healthy bees for all 
            the future generations after all. In this chapter we want to cover all the important ones and 
            explain everything about the damage done to the colonies by them. In the next chapter we will 
            discuss the ways of curing the bees and protecting them from all of the predators.

        <h2>Varroa mites</h2>

        <p>
            World's most wide-spread and devastating bee pest is the well known Varroa mite(Varroa destructor). They
            infest the western and asian honey bees(Apis mellifera, Apis cerana). You can recognize them by their 
            typical oval shaped body, 1–1.8 mm long and 1.5–2 mm wide, with 8 legs. The female mites have an orange 
            color sometimes with a bit of reddish hue. The males on the other hand are white or yellow and slightly 
            transparent. They are also more round than females.
        </p>
        <p>
            The female hides inside a brood cell 60-70 hours before it is capped and after that time, lays a single male egg
            (unfertilized one). Next she lays female eggs (fertilized ones) in intervals of approximately 30 hours. The males 
            take about 7 days to mature, whereas the females less than 6. During the two stages of development they feed on the
            fat body of the larva. After they are all mature the male mite mates with all the females. When the cell is uncapped,
            and the bee is getting out, all the females, including the original mother, leave it. The undeveloped mites and the
            male stay in the cell, where they die.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new females attach to the bees, who feed brood, they feed on their haemolymph and thanks to them get access to 
            the cells needed for reproduction. If it is possible the mites will prefer drone brood, since they have more time to
            lay more eggs. Single female may reproduce in up to seven cells, possibly laxing more than 30 eggs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The effects of the mites feeding on bees are dangerous for the whole colony.
            The fat body is important for the immune system and to help the bee survive the winter, but it does not develop properly, 
            which weakens the immune system. The bee is also put at a high risk, because the punctures left from the mouthparts of
            the mites, open up the way for infection. And as this wasn't bad enough, the mites even serve as a vector for about 
            20 different viruses, and many more are predicted to be spread by them.
