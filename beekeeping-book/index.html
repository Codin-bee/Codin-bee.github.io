        <h4>Diseases</h4>
        <p class="book-p">
            There are tens or maybe even hundreds of different pathogens, viruses, sicknesses and predators 
            threatening the bee colonies around the whole world. Some may be dangerous for the survival of 
            the colonies, while others may make it just a little bit harder, but as beekeepers we should try 
            our best to actively fight all of them. It is our duty to save strong and healthy bees for all 
            the future generations after all. In this chapter we want to cover all the important ones and 
            explain everything about the damage done to the colonies by them. In the next chapter we will 
            discuss the ways of curing the bees and protecting them from all of the predators.

        <h5>Varroa mite</h5>
        <p class="book-p">
            World's most wide-spread and devastating bee pest is the well known Varroa mite(Varroa destructor). They
            infest the western and asian honey bees(Apis mellifera, Apis cerana). You can recognize them by their 
            typical oval shaped body, 1–1.8 mm long and 1.5–2 mm wide, with 8 legs. The female mites have an orange 
            color sometimes with a bit of reddish hue. The males on the other hand are white or yellow and slightly 
            transparent. They are also more round than females.
        </p>
        <p class="book-p">
            The female hides inside a brood cell 60-70 hours before it is capped and after that time, lays a single male egg
            (unfertilized one). Next she lays female eggs (fertilized ones) in intervals of approximately 30 hours. The males 
            take about 7 days to mature, whereas the females less than 6. During the two stages of development they feed on the
            fat body of the larva. After they are all mature the male mite mates with all the females. When the cell is uncapped,
            and the bee is getting out, all the females, including the original mother, leave it. The undeveloped mites and the
            male stay in the cell, where they die.
        </p>
        <p class="book-p">
            The new females attach to the bees, who feed brood, they feed on their haemolymph and thanks to them get access to 
            the cells needed for reproduction. If it is possible the mites will prefer drone brood, since they have more time to
             lay more eggs. Single female may reproduce in up to seven cells, possibly laxing more than 30 eggs.
        </p>
        <p class="book-p">
            This might not seem that big of an issue, but the effects of the mites feeding on bees are dangerous for the whole colony.
            The fat body is important for the immune system and to help the bee survive the winter, but it does not develop properly, 
            which weakens the immune system. The bee is also put at a high risk, because the punctures left from the mouthparts of
            the mites, open up the way for infection. And as this wasn't bad enough, the mites even serve as a vector for about 
            20 different viruses, and many more are predicted to be spread by them.
        </p>



        <h5>Tropilaelaps mite</h5>
        <p class="book-p">
            Tropilaelaps mites affect bees in much the same way as Varroa destructor. They feed on the haemolymph of the bee brood, 
            impair its development, and use it for reproduction. Unlike Varroa, which does the most damage by spreading dangerous 
            viruses, Tropilaelaps mites directly harm the pupae, resulting in damaged legs, wings, and abdomens. While they also 
            spread viruses, Tropilaelaps mites can cause the collapse of an entire colony through their destructive feeding alone.
        </p>
        <p class="book-p">
            Native to Asia, Tropilaelaps mites originally parasitized Asian giant bees (e.g., Apis dorsata). However, two species 
            are also capable of parasitizing the European honey bee.
        </p>
        <p class="book-p">
            These mites have a color similar to Varroa but are slightly lighter. Their bodies are oval-shaped, with a relatively 
            short “head.” They have eight legs and measure about 0.5 mm in width and a little over 1 mm in length.

    <section class="book-chapter" id="reproduction">
        <h4>Reproduction</h4>
        <p class="book-p">
            Let's start with the worker bees. Their larvae are fed primarily honey and pollen; they get royal jelly 
            only in their first few days of life. In their diet there is also phenolic acid, which suppresses the 
            hormones activating the ovaries. Thanks to all these factors, their ovaries stay dormant their whole lives. 
            This phenomenon is called the atrophic reproductive system. But there is an exception to this. When the queen 
            dies, the worker bees still produce the royal jelly, but since there is no queen or larvae to feed it to, 
            they start consuming it themselves, and after about three weeks, all the brood and queen pheromones disappear. 
            This leads to their ovaries starting to work, but since they are not mated, they will always lay only 
            unfertilized (drone) eggs. Bees like this are called the drone-layers.
        </p>
        <p class="book-p">
            On the other hand, for the queen, laying eggs is her most important task. To ensure their reproductive
            organs are well developed, queen larvae are fed only royal jelly, which results in enough hormones in 
            their body, which cause the development of all the organs essential for mating and laying eggs. After
            the queen is born, it takes approximately 7 days until she is ready for mating. Then she takes a mating 
            flight. She leaves the hive with a few other bees and goes to a drone congregation area, where she mates
            during flight in the sky.
        </p>
        <p class="book-p">
            The congregation area, where drones are waiting for the queen, can have a varying diameter from 30 to 200
            meters. The mating happens 5-35 meters above the ground. Even though each year a new generation of drones
            is defining where the areas will be, in most cases they stay the same throughout the years. What exactly
            is causing them to select certain locations is still unknown. The further the area is from an apiary,
            the more drones visit them. There can be up to 25 thousand drones from 20 colonies in some cases.
        </p>
        <p class="book-p">
            The queen can be fertilized by 8-12 drones. The drone grabs the queen using cornua claspers and
            sticks its endophallus into her, and after a few seconds, dies. The ejaculation is so explosive,
            it can sometimes be heard by a human, making a popping sound. During this, most of the hemolymph 
            is moved to the penis, making the mating organs outside of his body nearly as big as the drone itself. 
            But his abdomen is strongly damaged during this act, which leads to his death. To ensure the queen 
            receives as much spermatozoa as possible, the drone's mating organs stay inside her after he dies and 
            falls off. Even this leads only to a partial success. The drone can produce about 12 million cells, 
            but less than 10% make it to the oviducts, and only a minority of them is actually stored in the 
            spermatheca at the end. The part of the endophallus left inside the queen is called a mating sign, 
            and the other drones usually have to get rid of it before mating.
        </p>
        <p class="book-p">
            After the queen comes back to the hive, it takes her a few days before she starts laying eggs.
            It may also take some time until she reaches her full speed, and she may even have problems choosing 
            which egg to fertilize in the first few days, but all this shouldn't be too noticeable. If it is, it 
            may be caused by some kind of disease or injury, rather than just starting mistakes. Eventually the 
            queen is able to lay up to 1,500-2,000 eggs per a single day. Thanks to this, the bee colony can have
            from 50 to 60 thousand bees in the midsummer. She can also become a drone-laying queen, same as with
            the worker bee, but this time it is caused either by running out of sperm, trouble during mating, or
            not being able to mate at all for a long time because of bad weather.
        </p>
        <p class="book-p">
            The drones take more than two weeks to become mature, approximately 16 days. After that there is a
            time window good for mating, but after their 28th day, the quality of semen is getting worse, and
            their probability to mate successfully is getting lower.
