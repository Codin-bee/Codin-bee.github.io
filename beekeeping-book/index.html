        <h4>Diseases and predators</h4>
        <p class="book-p">
            There are tens or maybe even hundreds of different pathogens, viruses, sicknesses and predators 
            threatening the bee colonies around the whole world. Some may be dangerous for the survival of 
            the colonies, while others may make it just a little bit harder, but as beekeepers we should try 
            our best to actively fight all of them. It is our duty to save strong and healthy bees for all 
            the future generations after all. In this chapter we want to cover all the important ones and 
            explain everything about the damage done to the colonies by them. In the next chapter we will 
            discuss the ways of curing the bees and protecting them from all of the predators.

        <h5>Varroa mite</h5>
        <p class="book-p">
            World's most wide-spread and devastating bee pest is the well known Varroa mite(Varroa destructor). 
            They infest the western and asian honey bees(Apis mellifera, Apis cerana).

        <h4>Reproduction</h4>
        <p class="book-p">
            Let's start with the worker bees. Their larvae are fed primarily honey and pollen; they get royal jelly 
            only in their first few days of life. In their diet there is also phenolic acid, which suppresses the 
            hormones activating the ovaries. Thanks to all these factors, their ovaries stay dormant their whole lives. 
            This phenomenon is called the atrophic reproductive system. But there is an exception to this. When the queen 
            dies, the worker bees still produce the royal jelly, but since there is no queen or larvae to feed it to, 
            they start consuming it themselves, and after about three weeks, all the brood and queen pheromones disappear. 
            This leads to their ovaries starting to work, but since they are not mated, they will always lay only 
            unfertilized (drone) eggs. Bees like this are called the drone-layers.
        </p>

        <p class="book-p">
            On the other hand, for the queen, laying eggs is her most important task. To ensure their reproductive
             organs are well developed, queen larvae are fed only royal jelly, which results in enough hormones in 
             their body, which cause the development of all the organs essential for mating and laying eggs. After
              the queen is born, it takes approximately 7 days until she is ready for mating. Then she takes a mating 
              flight. She leaves the hive with a few other bees and goes to a drone congregation area, where she mates
               during flight in the sky.
        </p>
        
        <p class="book-p">
            The congregation area, where drones are waiting for the queen, can have a varying diameter from 30 to 200
             meters. The mating happens 5-35 meters above the ground. Even though each year a new generation of drones
              is defining where the areas will be, in most cases they stay the same throughout the years. What exactly
               is causing them to select certain locations is still unknown. The further the area is from an apiary,
                the more drones visit them. There can be up to 25 thousand drones from 20 colonies in some cases.
        </p>
        
        <p class="book-p">
            The queen can be fertilized by 8-12 drones. The drone grabs the queen using cornua claspers and
             sticks its endophallus into her, and after a few seconds, dies. The ejaculation is so explosive,
              it can sometimes be heard by a human, making a popping sound. During this, most of the hemolymph 
              is moved to the penis, making the mating organs outside of his body nearly as big as the drone itself. 
              But his abdomen is strongly damaged during this act, which leads to his death. To ensure the queen 
              receives as much spermatozoa as possible, the drone's mating organs stay inside her after he dies and 
              falls off. Even this leads only to a partial success. The drone can produce about 12 million cells, 
              but less than 10% make it to the oviducts, and only a minority of them is actually stored in the 
              spermatheca at the end. The part of the endophallus left inside the queen is called a mating sign, 
              and the other drones usually have to get rid of it before mating.
        </p>

        <p class="book-p">
            After the queen comes back to the hive, it takes her a few days before she starts laying eggs.
             It may also take some time until she reaches her full speed, and she may even have problems choosing 
             which egg to fertilize in the first few days, but all this shouldn't be too noticeable. If it is, it 
             may be caused by some kind of disease or injury, rather than just starting mistakes. Eventually the 
             queen is able to lay up to 1,500-2,000 eggs per a single day. Thanks to this, the bee colony can have
              from 50 to 60 thousand bees in the midsummer. She can also become a drone-laying queen, same as with
               the worker bee, but this time it is caused either by running out of sperm, trouble during mating, or
                not being able to mate at all for a long time because of bad weather.
        </p>

        <p class="book-p">
            The drones take more than two weeks to become mature, approximately 16 days. After that there is a
             time window good for mating, but after their 28th day, the quality of semen is getting worse, and
              their probability to mate successfully is getting lower.
